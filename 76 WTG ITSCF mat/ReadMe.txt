Recordding signal inside .mat file:
3-phase current signal in timeseries format and unit Ampere (A): current1, current2, current3
3-phase voltage signal in timeseries format and unit Volt (V): voltage1, voltage2,voltage3

sampling frequency: 4kHz

More signal can be generated by simulink model inside Wind Turbine Simulink (ITCSF).zip
